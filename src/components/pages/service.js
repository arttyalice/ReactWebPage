                    <p className="normaltext">There are three choices of locations to establish a factory or construct an industrial unit:</p>

                    <h4>Industrial Estates</h4>
                    <p>An industrial estate has a specific definition in Thailand. Industrial estates are Serviced Industrial Land Plots (SILP), which are developed or managed by, or in joint venture with, the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT), a government organization.</p>

                    <h4>Industrial Parks / Zones</h4>
                    <p>Industrial parks are Serviced Industrial Land Plots developed without the IEAT, meaning they are privately owned, developed, marketed and managed. Since they are not linked to the IEAT, industrial investors cannot be granted privileges from the IEAT.</p>

                    <h4>Green Field Sites</h4>
                    <p>It is possible for a majority foreign-owned company to purchase a green field site, but only if they have Board of Investment (BOI) privileges.</p>

                    <h4>Warehouses and Distribution Centres</h4>
                    <p>There are only a limited number of modern warehouses and distribution centres available for sale and rent. The most common type of warehouse is a stand-alone single storey building, usually located outside an industrial estate or park.</p>
